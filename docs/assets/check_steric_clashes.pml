## Check a protein for steric clashes ##

# This script identifies a small steric clash created by the T4 lysozyme A129F substitution. First, it shows the wt protein (pdb code: 1l63) with no steric clash near Ala129. Next, modify the script to show A129F (pdb code: 1QTC), which shows a little steric clash near Phe129, but less than might be expected because the surrounding region adjusts for the addition of the large phenyl group.

# T4 lysozyme A129F is nevertheless destabilized relative to the wild type. The melting temperature of the A129F variant (94 째C) is 19 째C lower than that for the wild type (113 째C). The measured free energy of unfolding is 1.2 kcal/mol lower at 40 째C for the A129F variant indicating that it is less stable.

# Instructions:

# open PyMOL
# drag this file onto the PyMOL viewing window, which will run all the command below.
# this script shows the wt protein and should show no steric clashes.

# To view the A129F protein, remove the '## ' from two commands below (one starting with fetch, the other with util) and place the '## ' in front of the corresponding commands for the wt protein. Then rerun the script. It should show a tiny bit more steric clashing.

# clear any PyMOL settings and set working directory
reinitialize
cd ~/Desktop

# the python definition below defines the command to show bumping interactions
